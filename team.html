                        I am an architect that has been strongly influenced by the experience 
                        of growing up in three different countries, including graduating from 
                        high school in London. I have also been strongly influenced in terms 
                        of my professional direction by my educational experience, particularly 
                        attending business school at the same time as architecture school. 
                        I have been very fortunate to have had some excellent teachers and 
                        associates along the way that have contributed towards my constant 
                        education as an architect. I was also fortunate to end up in the 
                        wonderful state of California with its amazing coastal areas and 
                        Los Angeles with its second to none car culture.

                        I have enjoyed an interesting and varied career in architecture, being 
                        involved with a wide variety of building types, including office buildings, 
                        retail centers, hotels, multi-family and mixed-use projects, industrial 
                        and master planning work. I have also had years of experience in principal 
                        level office organization and management, along with marketing and business 
                        development. I am happy to be back in Southern California and working 
                        in a busy and exciting firm with a great group of interesting people.

                        I was born in Buffalo, New York, moved to Ft Lauderdale in the 6th grade 
                        and finally to Los Angeles in 1997. I enjoy L.A. so I think my clockwise 
                        tour of the United States is complete. I’ve been with Dietrich since 2011 and 
                        enjoy the environment and culture that we have built and continue to evolve. 
                        I enjoy spending my time away from the office with my two young daughters 
                        and wife.

                        Growing up in a small Midwest town, I would have never guessed 
                        I would some day end up an architect in Southern California. 
                        I have been employed at a few small firms in the Los Angeles 
                        area working on a variety of project types and scales including 
                        entitlements, luxury single-family residential, multi-family, 
                        and commercial projects. Dietrich Architects is fortunate to have 
                        a diverse group of clients, projects and colleagues. I strive 
                        to contribute to and strengthen the office’s projects and culture 
                        using my design sense and skills as an architect as well as 
                        my Midwestern grit and tenacity.
